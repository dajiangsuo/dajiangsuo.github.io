Dajiang Suo is an incoming Assistant Professor at Arizona State University. As a research scientist at [MIT Auto-ID Lab](https://autoid.mit.edu/), Suo researches the Internet of Things to build intelligent transportation infrastructure. He is also a principal investigator who has been leaving connected-vehicle research projects at [MIT Mobility Initiative](https://www.mmi.mit.edu/research). Dr. Suo obtained a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 2020.

Before returning to school to pursue a Ph.D. degree, Suo was with the vehicle control and autonomous driving team at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI), working on the safety and cyber-security of automated vehicles. He also serves as a committee member and the paper review coordinator on the [Standing Committee on Enterprise, Systems, and Cyber Resilience (AMR40)](https://www.trbamr40.org/) at the Transportation Research Board. 
Open Positions
------
I am looking for Ph.D. applicants to work on connected vehicle cyber-security, vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, and smart city sensing. If you are interested in joining us, please send me an [email](mailto:dajiang.suo@asu.edu) with your CV and a brief statement about your research objectives. 

Cyber-Resilient Electrified and Automated Transportation Engineering (CREATE) Lab at ASU
------
From the visionary sketches of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century to today's cutting-edge technologies, the human pursuit of autonomy has been an enduring and ever-evolving endeavor. The world has seen significant strides in designing vehicles that can navigate themselves in varying conditions. Yet, at the CREAT Research Lab, we posit an intriguing question: What if, instead of solely perfecting the vehicles, we enhanced the environment they operate within? This is where our concept of 'smart roads' comes into play.

Drawing inspiration from cross-domain cooperation, we aim to revolutionize the way autonomous vehicles interact with their surroundings. By investing in intelligent road infrastructures, we potentially alleviate the need for vehicles to be equipped with perfect sensing systems, thus presenting a cost-effective and holistic approach to full autonomy.

Current research thrusts
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Connected vehicle cyber security
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Vehicle-Infrastructure collective sensing
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

Zero Energy vehicle-to-infrastructure communication
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
