I am an Assistant Professor at Arizona State University. Before that, I was a research scientist at [MIT Auto-ID Lab](https://autoid.mit.edu/), researching the Internet of Things to build intelligent transportation infrastructure. I was also a principal investigator leading infrastructure sensing and connected vehicle research projects at [MIT Mobility Initiative](https://www.mmi.mit.edu/research). I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 2020, supervised by Prof. [Sanjay Sarma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=r9UmpGUAAAAJ&hl=en). During my postdoc training, I also worked with Prof. [Jinhua Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bC0BOGoAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Cathy Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wyjZbeMAAAAJ&hl=en) on autonomy and mobility systems. 

Before returning to school to pursue a Ph.D. degree, I was with the vehicle control and autonomous driving team at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI), working on the safety and cyber-security of automated vehicles. I also serves as a committee member and the paper review coordinator on the [Standing Committee on Enterprise, Systems, and Cyber Resilience (AMR40)](https://www.trbamr40.org/) at the Transportation Research Board. 

While at ASU, I was devoted to research and teaching in various IoT-related areas, including transportation and beyond. For instance, in the IoT-focused course I am teaching in Spring 2024 ([ASU EGR 304](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/oqrymr9s5thxfzjkt0cai/project_description.pdf?rlkey=67fa9uzczxn11uzg7ziorx9uz&dl=0)), I integrate modules that explore the use of emerging IoT and sensing technologies to improve safety and productivity on construction sites, highlighting the breadth of my research interests in smart cities.

## Open Positions

If you are interested in joining us, please send me an [email](mailto:dajiang.suo@asu.edu) with your CV and a brief statement about your research objectives.
  * We warmly welcome visiting scholars for collaboration. For inquiries and opportunities, contact Dr. [Suo](mailto:dajiang.suo@asu.edu).


## Research Philosophy: Empowering Autonomous Systems through Smart Infrastructure
------
From the visionary sketches of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century to today's cutting-edge technologies, the human pursuit of autonomy has been an enduring and ever-evolving endeavor. The world has seen significant strides in designing ground and aerial vehicles capable of self-navigation under varying conditions. At the CREAT Research Lab at ASU, we explore a compelling question: What if, instead of focusing solely on perfecting the autonomous systems, we enhanced the environments in which they operate? This is where our concept of 'smart infrastructure' becomes vital.

Inspired by cross-domain collaboration, our research seeks to transform the interaction between unmanned ground (UGVs) and aerial vehicles (UAVs) and their surroundings. By developing intelligent infrastructure, we enable a more seamless, reliable, and efficient operation of autonomous systems under off-nominal scenarios. This approach not only complements and supports the evolution of on-vehicle intelligence but also provides a cost-effective path for vehicles to achieve full autonomy.
