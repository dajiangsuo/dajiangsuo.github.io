Dajiang Suo is an incoming Assistant Professor at Arizona State University. As a research scientist at [MIT Auto-ID Lab](https://autoid.mit.edu/), Suo researches the Internet of Things to build intelligent transportation infrastructure. He is also a principal investigator who has been leaving connected-vehicle research projects at [MIT Mobility Initiative](https://www.mmi.mit.edu/research). Dr. Suo obtained a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 2020.

Before returning to school to pursue a Ph.D. degree, Suo was with the vehicle control and autonomous driving team at Ford Motor Company (Dearborn, MI), working on the safety and cyber-security of automated vehicles. He also serves as a committee member and the paper review coordinator on the [Standing Committee on Enterprise, Systems, and Cyber Resilience (AMR40)](https://www.trbamr40.org/) at the Transportation Research Board. 

Open Positions
------
I am looking for Ph.D. applicants to work on connected vehicle cyber-security, vehicle-infrastructure cooperation, and smart city sensing. If you are interested in joining us, please send me an [email](mailto:dajiang.suo@asu.edu) with your CV and a brief statement about your research objectives. 

Cyber-Resilient Electrified and Automated Transportation Engineering (CREATE) Lab at ASU
------
From the visionary sketches of Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century to today's cutting-edge technologies, the human pursuit of autonomy has been an enduring and ever-evolving endeavor. The world has seen significant strides in designing vehicles that can navigate themselves in varying conditions. Yet, at the CREAT Research Lab, we posit an intriguing question: What if, instead of solely perfecting the vehicles, we enhanced the environment they operate within? This is where our concept of 'smart roads' comes into play.

Drawing inspiration from cross-domain cooperation, we aim to revolutionize the way autonomous vehicles interact with their surroundings. By investing in intelligent road infrastructure, we may potentially alleviate the need for vehicles to be equipped with perfect sensing systems, thus presenting a cost-effective and holistic approach to full autonomy.
